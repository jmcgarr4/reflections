When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-  A remote repository would be useful for shared projects. It also works as a good back-up in case something happens to my computer. Thirdly, if I am working on something across computers the github repo would be a good place to keep the info so that I can access it from different places.
