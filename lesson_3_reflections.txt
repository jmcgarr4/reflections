When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-  A remote repository would be useful for shared projects. It also works as a good back-up in case something happens to my computer. Thirdly, if I am working on something across computers the github repo would be a good place to keep the info so that I can access it from different places.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 - I might make changes that I don't want to keep (and for some reason I don't want to start a new branch), or I might not want my changes to become public (yet). Also, when exactly would Git push/pull, it wouldn't be helpful to push/pull in the middle of a task.   

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

 - A branch is a series of commits done within a specific repo, best used to test new features or keep a portion of a project private. A clone is a complete copy of a repo (most often copied from Github to a local computer), used when one wants to build upon someone else's work or simply to have a copy. A branch is a github --> github copy, best used when one wants to create a public version of someone else's project and edit it.  

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
