What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- Initializing the repository creates the initial .git file, and tells git to track everything in the folder / project. Without the initialization, the version control does not begin.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

- The staging area allows me to specify which files / changes / creations I want to track. I may not to track everything (or I may not want to track everything all at once), so the staging area allows me to control what gets tracked.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

- One can add edited files to the staging area one at a time, and then commit them separately. (It's worth remembering that files can be added and committed together -- best to do this only if the changes are related)
