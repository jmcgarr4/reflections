Instead of reading through thousands of lines, the diff command helpfully displayed the differences.
It was still necessary to read through the code for each file,
but at least it was doable manually.
It would have been even better if the differences were highlighted within the lines.

Update: Having easy access to the history of the file will allow me to much more easily correct all of the mistakes that I will inevitably make!
Yeah.
